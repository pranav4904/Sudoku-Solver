# Sudoku-Solver
Developed a Sudoku solver utilizing the Backtracking algorithm. It is designed to tackle Sudoku puzzles by accommodating random user-generated entries. 

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. The grid is subdivided into 3x3 subgrids, and the objective is to fill in the entire grid in such a way that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

## Solver Features
Random User-Generated Entries: The solver is capable of handling Sudoku puzzles with random user-generated entries. This means users can input their partially completed puzzles, and the solver will efficiently find the solution while adhering to the rules of Sudoku.

Backtracking Algorithm: The solver employs the Backtracking algorithm to navigate through the solution space. Backtracking is a recursive approach that systematically explores possible solutions, making choices at each step and backtracking when necessary. This ensures an optimal and systematic search for a valid solution.

## How to Use
To use the Sudoku solver, simply input the initial puzzle with the provided user-generated entries. The solver will then apply the Backtracking algorithm to find the solution.

## Integration and Contributions
Feel free to integrate this Sudoku solver into your applications or contribute to its improvement. The Backtracking algorithm provides a solid foundation for efficient problem-solving, and enhancements or adaptations can be made to suit specific requirements.
